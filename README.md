# FOLIO AI SDLC Factory

An AI-driven, plugin-based orchestration platform for the FOLIO software
development lifecycle. Flows are **data** (YAML plugin descriptors), agents are
stateless workers that communicate only through **immutable versioned
artifacts**, and every consequential step passes a **human-in-the-loop gate**.

Milestone 1 ships the shared orchestration framework plus **the Test Factory
flow**: Jira story → scope manifest → manual test plan → QA review →
generated Karate scripts → (advisory or real) execution → QA sign-off →
TestRail / GitHub / Jira sync.

## Architecture

```
factory-core/                the control plane (no knowledge of any flow)
  registry/    FlowRegistry — scans classpath*:flows/*.yaml, validates, mirrors to DB
  engine/      ExecutionEngine (step cursor), ExecutionPoller (DB polling,
               FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, lease reaper), retry budgets, escalation
  agent/       AgentWorker SPI + registry (scope-bounded AgentContext)
  hitl/        HitlDecisionService — approve / amend / reject semantics
  service/     StateManager, ArtifactStore (insert-only versioning), AuditLog (append-only)
  trigger/     PipelineRouter — data-driven trigger contract matching
factory-connectors/          Jira, GitHub, TestRail REST clients + graceful fallbacks
factory-agents/              LLM base worker (Spring AI ChatClient), prompt loading,
                             frontmatter codec, secret-scan post-processor
factory-flow-test-factory/   Test Factory plugin: flows/test-factory.yaml + 5 workers + prompts
factory-app/                 Spring Boot app: REST API, HITL web UI, Flyway, config
```

Key invariants, enforced by the framework:

- **Plugin flows** — adding a flow = new module with a `flows/*.yaml` descriptor
  and worker beans. Zero control-plane changes (`factory-core` cannot even
  compile against a flow module).
- **Immutable artifacts** — agents only read declared inputs and write new
  artifact versions; reviewer amendments become attributed versions.
- **Bounded retry** — 3 attempts per step (configurable per flow), then the
  execution escalates into the same human review inbox.
- **Append-only audit** — every step, artifact write, decision and sub-flow
  invocation; the DB blocks UPDATE/DELETE on the audit table.
- **Sub-flow composition** — any flow can invoke any registered flow; the
  parent waits (including through the child's HITL gates) and collects mapped
  output artifacts. Built now; Flow E will compose Flows A and D with it.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: Java 21, Maven 3.9+, Docker.

```bash
# 1. Database
docker compose up -d

# 2. LLM provider (Spring AI — Anthropic by default, swappable via config)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# 3. Run
mvn spring-boot:run -pl factory-app

# 4. Trigger the Test Factory flow with the bundled sample story (no Jira needed — issue inline)
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/triggers/manual \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @factory-app/src/main/resources/samples/sample-story-inline.json
```

Then open the management UI at <http://localhost:8080/> — a dashboard with KPI
cards and charts. Work the two QA gates at <http://localhost:8080/reviews>
(approve/amend/reject — edits are saved as new artifact versions) and watch
progress at <http://localhost:8080/executions> (full audit timeline per
execution). The rest of the console: `/flows`
and `/workers` (registered flow plugins and the agent worker library), `/prompts`
(read-only viewer for each worker's bundled prompt templates), `/audit` (the
append-only event log) and `/status` (engine and connector health).

Manual triggers are never deduplicated by default — re-running the curl starts a
new execution. To opt a manual trigger into dedup, add an idempotency key to the
request body: `{"flowId": "...", "payload": {...}, "dedupKey": "my-key"}`
(trimmed; max 255 characters, else 422; blank treated as absent). Webhook
triggers dedup automatically via `factory.limits.dedup.*`.

Without any connector credentials the flow still completes end-to-end: test
execution runs in **advisory mode** and every external sync is recorded as
`CONNECTOR_SKIPPED` in the audit log and the `sync_report.md` artifact.

## Container image

A multi-stage `Dockerfile` at the repo root builds `factory-app`'s Spring Boot
jar on a Temurin 21 + Maven 3.9 stage and runs the extracted layered jar on a
minimal `eclipse-temurin:21-jre` runtime as a non-root user, with a `HEALTHCHECK`
against `/actuator/health`.

```bash
docker build -t folio-factory-app:local .

# needs a reachable PostgreSQL — start one with `docker compose up -d`
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e FACTORY_DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://host.docker.internal:5432/factory \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
  folio-factory-app:local
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds on JDK 21, runs `mvn verify`
(Testcontainers on GitHub-hosted runners), uploads test reports + the CycloneDX
SBOM, and builds the Docker image. A weekly `dependency-check.yml` runs an
opt-in OWASP scan (`mvn -Powasp verify`); Dependabot keeps Maven and Actions
dependencies current.

## Operations

Production procedures live under `doc/`:

- [`doc/runbook.md`](doc/runbook.md) — execution lifecycle, recovering stuck
  runs, draining for deploy, metrics & suggested alerts, cost controls, retention.
- [`doc/backup-dr.md`](doc/backup-dr.md) — PostgreSQL backup/PITR, the
  restore drill, and audit-log durability. Helper: [`scripts/pg-backup.sh`](scripts/pg-backup.sh).
- [`doc/performance.md`](doc/performance.md) — DB pool sizing rationale and a
  load-test plan.

Metrics are exposed at `/actuator/prometheus`; Kubernetes probes at
`/actuator/health/liveness` and `/readiness`. Set `FACTORY_LOG_FORMAT=ecs` (or
`logstash`) for structured JSON logs with `executionId`/`stepId` correlation.

Webhooks: `POST /api/webhooks/jira` and `/api/webhooks/github`
(shared secret: `FACTORY_WEBHOOKS_SHARED_SECRET` checked against `?token=`).
**Webhooks are unauthenticated while the secret is unset** — the app logs a
warning at startup; always set it in non-local deployments.

## Adding a new flow (the plugin pattern)

1. Create a module (or reuse one) with `src/main/resources/flows/my-flow.yaml`:
   triggers, `agent_chain` of `AGENT` / `HITL_GATE` / `SUB_FLOW` steps with
   declared `inputs`/`outputs`, retry policy.
2. Implement any new `AgentWorker` beans (existing workers are reusable by id).
3. Add the module to `factory-app`'s dependencies.

The registry discovers the descriptor at startup, validates worker ids and
sub-flow references, mirrors the YAML to the database, and the router begins
routing matching triggers. No engine, router or gateway changes.

**[doc/extending-the-factory.md](doc/extending-the-factory.md) is the full
guide**: a step-by-step tutorial building a complete flow (LLM worker,
prompts, HITL gate, connector-backed worker), plus in-depth chapters on
triggers and webhooks, worker failure/retry semantics, prompt and artifact
conventions, sub-flow composition, quality post-processors, adding
connectors, per-flow configuration, testing patterns, and adopting the
platform on a non-FOLIO project. The YAML schema itself is specified in
[doc/flow-descriptor-reference.md](doc/flow-descriptor-reference.md).

## Verification

```bash
mvn verify        # unit + integration tests (Testcontainers PostgreSQL; Docker required)
```

The suite includes two full Test Factory end-to-end tests (scripted LLM, WireMock'd
Jira/GitHub/TestRail): the happy path with a QA amendment at gate 1, and the
zero-credentials path. Engine semantics (retry → escalation, poller crash
recovery, sub-flow parent/child, HITL decisions) are covered in
`factory-core`'s integration tests.
